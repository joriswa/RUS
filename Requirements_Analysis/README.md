- Priority classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Complete dependency mapping between requirements

### âœ… Enhanced Traceability
- 67 mapped dependency relationships
- Clear source attribution for all requirements
- Implementation roadmap based on dependencies

## Usage

- **For Development**: Use `Master_Requirements_Specification.csv` as the primary reference
- **For Category-Specific Work**: Use individual category files (e.g., `Safety_Requirements.csv`)
- **For Analysis**: Review documentation files for detailed explanations and metrics

## File Formats

- **CSV Files**: Structured requirements data suitable for import into requirements management tools
- **Markdown Files**: Human-readable documentation and analysis reports
