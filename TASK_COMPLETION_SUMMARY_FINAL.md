# Task Completion Summary

## Objective
Add the ability to select between STOMP and Hauser algorithms for trajectory replanning in USLib, with configuration for each. Remove resampling from the Hauser implementation in MotionGenerator; for STOMP, replace resampling with a quintic polynomial fit that prioritizes zero boundary conditions but also fits the trajectory points well. Ensure logging is properly integrated in USLib. Update code and documentation to reflect these changes. Ensure Hauser is used correctly: always run a path planner to generate a collision-free path before running Hauser.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Algorithm Selection Framework
- **Added TrajectoryPlanningAlgorithm enum** with STOMP and HAUSER options
- **Added TrajectoryPlanningConfig struct** with algorithm selection and algorithm-specific configurations
- **Updated USTrajectoryPlanner class** to accept and use planning configuration
- **Implemented algorithm switching** in all trajectory planning methods

### 2. ✅ USLib Algorithm Integration
- **Updated planSingleTrajectory()** to use selected algorithm (STOMP or Hauser)
- **Updated planTrajectoryWithCheckpoints()** to use selected algorithm
- **Updated parallel execution methods** to use selected algorithm for all trajectory segments
- **Added generateTrajectoryFromCheckpoints usage** for STOMP checkpoint-based planning
- **Preserved contact force and free motion trajectory flags**

### 3. ✅ Correct Hauser Implementation Pattern
- **Fixed planSingleTrajectory()**: Now runs path planner first, then Hauser with collision-free waypoints
- **Fixed planTrajectoryWithCheckpoints()**: Runs path planner between each consecutive checkpoint pair, combines waypoints, then runs Hauser
- **Fixed parallel execution (scan segments)**: Uses path planning between consecutive scan poses before Hauser
- **Fixed parallel execution (point-to-point)**: Uses path planning for connections between segments before Hauser
- **All Hauser usages now follow the correct pattern**: PathPlanner → collision-free waypoints → Hauser optimization

### 4. ✅ MotionGenerator Resampling Changes
- **Removed resampling from Hauser implementation**: No longer applies resampling to Hauser results
- **Implemented quintic polynomial fitting for STOMP**: New `applyQuinticPolynomialFit()` method
- **Weighted least squares approach**: Balances trajectory adherence with smooth boundary conditions
- **Zero velocity/acceleration boundaries**: Ensures smooth start/stop conditions
- **Tested and verified**: Standalone tests confirm proper functionality

### 5. ✅ Logging Integration
- **Restored logging dependencies** in USLib CMakeLists.txt
- **Verified logging includes** and usage throughout USLib
- **Maintained existing logging functionality** while adding new features

### 6. ✅ Build System and Compatibility
- **All changes compile successfully** with existing build system
- **No breaking changes** to existing interfaces
- **Backward compatibility maintained** for existing code
- **Thread-safe parallel execution** preserved

### 7. ✅ Documentation
- **Created USLIB_ALGORITHM_SELECTION_BRIEF.md**: Overview of new algorithm selection features
- **Created MOTION_GENERATOR_RESAMPLING_CHANGES.md**: Detailed explanation of resampling modifications
- **Updated this completion summary**: Complete task status and implementation details

## Key Technical Achievements

### Algorithm Selection Architecture
```cpp
enum class TrajectoryPlanningAlgorithm {
    STOMP,
    HAUSER
};

struct TrajectoryPlanningConfig {
    TrajectoryPlanningAlgorithm algorithm = TrajectoryPlanningAlgorithm::STOMP;
    StompConfig stompConfig;
    int hauserMaxIterations = 1000;
    int hauserOutputFrequency = 100;
};
```

### Correct Hauser Usage Pattern
For all Hauser implementations, the pattern is now:
1. **Setup PathPlanner** with obstacle tree
2. **Set start and goal configurations** from trajectory checkpoints
3. **Run path planning** to get collision-free waypoints
4. **Set waypoints in MotionGenerator** from path planning results
5. **Run Hauser optimization** on collision-free path

### STOMP Polynomial Fitting
- **Weighted least squares optimization** with configurable weights
- **Zero boundary conditions** for velocity and acceleration
- **Trajectory point adherence** balanced with smoothness requirements
- **Replaces simple resampling** with mathematically rigorous approach

### Multi-Checkpoint Handling
- **Point-to-point path planning** between consecutive checkpoints
- **Waypoint combination** with duplicate point removal
- **Parallel execution support** for both algorithms
- **Error handling** for failed path planning attempts
