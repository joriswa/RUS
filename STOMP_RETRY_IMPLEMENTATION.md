# STOMP Retry Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated retry functionality into the STOMP (Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning) algorithm. This enhancement improves robustness by allowing multiple attempts when STOMP fails to find a valid solution.

## Implementation Details

### Header File Changes (`MotionGenerator.h`)
- Updated `performSTOMP` method signature to include `int maxRetries = 1` parameter
- Maintains backward compatibility with default value of 1 retry

```cpp
bool performSTOMP(const StompConfig &config,
                  std::shared_ptr<boost::asio::thread_pool> sharedPool = nullptr,
                  int trajectoryIndex = -1,
                  int maxRetries = 1);
```

### Implementation Changes (`MotionGenerator.cpp`)
- Added retry loop around the main STOMP optimization algorithm
- Each retry attempt is logged with attempt number and total attempts
- Failed attempts are logged with warning messages
- Early exit on success or when maximum retries reached
- Proper debug state restoration regardless of success/failure

### Key Features
1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing calls continue to work unchanged
2. **Configurable Retries**: Users can specify any number of retry attempts
3. **Detailed Logging**: Clear logging of retry attempts and failures
4. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and state restoration
5. **Performance Aware**: No overhead when using default single attempt

### Usage Examples

#### Default Usage (1 retry, backward compatible)
```cpp
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config);
```

#### With Custom Retry Count
```cpp
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config, nullptr, -1, 3); // 3 attempts
```

#### With Thread Pool and Retries
```cpp
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config, threadPool, trajectoryIndex, 5); // 5 attempts
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Success Rate**: Multiple attempts increase likelihood of finding valid solutions
2. **Robust Operation**: Handles temporary failures or poor random initialization
3. **Flexible Configuration**: Users can balance success rate vs computation time
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work without modification
5. **Clear Feedback**: Detailed logging helps understand optimization behavior

## Verification

- Code compiles successfully with existing build system
- All existing applications continue to work unchanged
- Parameter evaluator, PathPlanner GUI, and other tools maintain compatibility
- No performance impact for default single-attempt usage

## Integration Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Retry functionality is now fully integrated into the STOMP system and ready for use.

The implementation provides a robust foundation for improved trajectory planning success rates while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing code.
