## 1. Introduction

Ultrasound (US) imaging has emerged as one of the most widely utilized diagnostic modalities in clinical practice due to its non-invasive nature, absence of ionizing radiation, real-time imaging capabilities, and cost-effectiveness [1]. However, conventional freehand ultrasound examinations suffer from significant limitations, primarily the high degree of operator dependency that affects image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and examination reproducibility [2]. These limitations have motivated the development of Robotic Ultrasound Systems (RUS) as a technological solution to enhance diagnostic outcomes while addressing the global shortage of experienced sonographers.

The integration of robotics into ultrasound imaging aims to overcome fundamental challenges in manual scanning by providing:
- **Reproducibility**: Standardized scanning protocols that reduce inter-operator variability
- **Precision**: Accurate probe positioning and consistent contact force regulation
- **Accessibility**: Remote diagnostic capabilities for underserved populations
- **Efficiency**: Automated scanning procedures that reduce sonographer workload
- **Safety**: Controlled interaction forces and collision avoidance systems

RUS can be broadly categorized into two operational paradigms: teleoperated systems that enable remote control by experienced sonographers, and autonomous systems that perform scanning procedures with minimal human intervention [3]. While teleoperated systems have demonstrated clinical viability, autonomous RUS represents the frontier of intelligent medical robotics, incorporating machine learning, computer vision, and advanced control algorithms to achieve human-level scanning capabilities.

This literature review examines the current state-of-the-art in robotic ultrasound systems, analyzes key technical challenges, and identifies critical research gaps, with particular focus on the underexplored domain of knee ultrasound applications.
