- **Average execution time**: 98.3 ms (all attempts), 108.9 ms (successful only)
- **Time range**: 53.4 - 164.3 ms
- **Standard deviation**: 46.2 ms
- **Analysis**: Fastest method overall, tied for best success rate with Newton-Raphson

#### ü•â selectGoalPose (Reliability Leader)
- **Success rate**: 100.0% (10/10 poses)
- **Average execution time**: 798.9 ms
- **Time range**: 352.8 - 1318.8 ms
- **Standard deviation**: 312.7 ms
- **Analysis**: Most reliable but significantly slower, 7-8x longer execution time

#### ‚ùå Damped_LS (Poor Performance)
- **Success rate**: 0.0% (0/10 poses)
- **Average execution time**: 183.8 ms
- **Standard deviation**: 1.4 ms
- **Average iterations**: 100.0 (max iterations reached)
- **Analysis**: Failed on all middle poses, consistently hitting iteration limits

### Pose-Specific Insights

#### Most Challenging Poses
- **Poses 6 and 7**: Only 50.0% success rate (2/4 methods successful)
- **All other poses**: 75.0% success rate (3/4 methods successful)

#### Fastest Successful Solutions by Pose
- **Pose 5**: Newton-Raphson (97.1 ms)
- **Pose 6**: Newton-Raphson (69.8 ms)
- **Pose 7**: SA-Optimized (128.1 ms)
- **Pose 8**: SA-Optimized (53.4 ms) - overall fastest
- **Pose 9**: Newton-Raphson (84.5 ms)
- **Pose 10**: Newton-Raphson (56.9 ms)
- **Pose 11**: SA-Optimized (84.5 ms)
- **Pose 12**: Newton-Raphson (98.0 ms)
- **Pose 13**: Newton-Raphson (86.4 ms)
- **Pose 14**: SA-Optimized (88.4 ms)

### Computational Efficiency Analysis

#### Iterative Methods Comparison
- **Newton-Raphson**: 1.80 ms/iteration (55.6 avg iterations)
- **Damped_LS**: Unable to calculate (0% success rate)

### Key Recommendations

1. **Primary Choice**: **Newton-Raphson** - Best overall performer with excellent balance of speed (101ms avg) and reliability (90% success)

2. **Speed Priority**: **SA-Optimized** - Slightly faster than Newton-Raphson (98.3ms avg) with equal reliability

3. **Reliability Priority**: **selectGoalPose** - 100% success rate but 7-8x slower execution time (799ms avg)

4. **Avoid**: **Damped_LS** - Poor performance on these poses (0% success rate)

### Method Selection Strategy
- **Real-time applications**: Newton-Raphson or SA-Optimized
- **Critical applications**: selectGoalPose (when reliability is paramount)
- **Hybrid approach**: Start with Newton-Raphson/SA-Optimized, fallback to selectGoalPose
