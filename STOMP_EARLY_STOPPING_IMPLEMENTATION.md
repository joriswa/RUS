# STOMP Early Stopping Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented an early stopping criterion for STOMP that terminates optimization once a collision-free trajectory is found, significantly improving performance for scenarios where the first collision-free solution is acceptable.

## Changes Made

### 1. StompConfig Structure (MotionGenerator.h)
Added two new configuration parameters:
```cpp
bool enableEarlyStopping = false;      // Enable early stopping when collision-free trajectory found
int earlyStoppingPatience = 1;         // Number of consecutive collision-free iterations before stopping
```

### 2. New Factory Methods
- `StompConfig::withEarlyStopping(int patience = 1)` - Creates config with early stopping enabled
- Updated `StompConfig::fast()` to enable early stopping by default for maximum speed

### 3. Core Logic (MotionGenerator.cpp)
- Added early stopping counter and configuration reading
- Implemented logic to track consecutive collision-free iterations
- Added early stopping trigger with configurable patience
- Reset counter when collision is detected again
- Enhanced logging to show early stopping progress

## Usage Examples

### Basic Early Stopping
```cpp
// Stop immediately when first collision-free trajectory is found
auto config = StompConfig::withEarlyStopping(1);
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config);
```

### Conservative Early Stopping
```cpp
// Wait for 3 consecutive collision-free iterations before stopping
auto config = StompConfig::withEarlyStopping(3);
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config);
```

### Fast Configuration (Early Stopping Enabled by Default)
```cpp
// Optimized for speed with early stopping enabled
auto config = StompConfig::fast();
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config);
```

### Manual Configuration
```cpp
auto config = StompConfig::optimized();
config.enableEarlyStopping = true;
config.earlyStoppingPatience = 2;
bool success = motionGenerator.performSTOMP(config);
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance Improvement**: Can terminate early when collision-free solution found
2. **Configurable Patience**: Balance between speed and solution quality
3. **Backward Compatible**: Default behavior unchanged (early stopping disabled)
4. **Robust Logic**: Handles cases where algorithm temporarily finds collision-free then hits collision again
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Clear indication of early stopping triggers

## Implementation Details

- **Thread Safe**: Uses existing atomic collision detection
- **Convergence Integration**: Works alongside existing cost convergence criteria
- **Logging**: Comprehensive debug and info logging for monitoring
- **Reset Logic**: Counter resets if collision detected after collision-free iterations
- **Quality Preservation**: Still tracks best collision-free trajectory found

## Performance Impact

- **Best Case**: Dramatic speedup when collision-free solution found early
- **Worst Case**: No performance penalty if no collision-free solution found
- **Memory**: Minimal additional memory overhead (few integer counters)
- **Robustness**: Maintains all existing robustness features while adding early exit capability

## Recommended Settings

- **patience = 1**: Maximum speed, stops at first collision-free trajectory
- **patience = 3-5**: Good balance between speed and solution refinement
- **patience = 10+**: Conservative approach, allows significant optimization of collision-free solution

This implementation significantly enhances STOMP performance for scenarios where finding any collision-free trajectory quickly is more important than finding the globally optimal trajectory.
