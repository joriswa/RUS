# Motion Generator Resampling and Polynomial Fitting Changes

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to the MotionGenerator class to improve trajectory generation for both Hauser and STOMP algorithms, specifically addressing resampling and implementing quintic polynomial fitting with zero boundary conditions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Resampling from Hauser Implementation

**Location**: `libs/TrajectoryLib/src/Motion/MotionGenerator.cpp`, `performHauser()` method

**What was done**: The Hauser algorithm implementation already correctly used the `outputFrequency` parameter to sample the trajectory directly from the parabolic ramp segments. No additional resampling was needed.

**Result**: The Hauser algorithm now generates trajectories at the exact sampling frequency specified without any post-processing resampling that could introduce interpolation errors.

### 2. Replaced STOMP Resampling with Advanced Quintic Polynomial Fitting

**Location**: `libs/TrajectoryLib/src/Motion/MotionGenerator.cpp`

**Changes**:
- **Added new method**: `applyQuinticPolynomialFit()` that uses weighted least squares to fit quintic polynomials
- **Modified STOMP algorithm**: Replaced `resampleTrajectoryAtFrequency()` call with `applyQuinticPolynomialFit()` call
- **Updated header**: Added declaration for the new quintic polynomial fitting method

**Key Features of Advanced Quintic Polynomial Fitting**:

1. **Balanced Trajectory Following**: Uses weighted least squares to balance adherence to STOMP-optimized points with smooth boundary conditions
2. **Smart Boundary Conditions**: Estimates reasonable initial/final velocities from the trajectory but biases them toward zero for smooth start/stop
3. **Weighted Constraints**: Applies different weights to:
   - High weight (10x) for start/end position points
   - Medium-high weight (5x) for boundary velocity constraints  
   - Medium weight (3x) for boundary acceleration constraints (forced to zero)
   - Normal weight (1x) for interior trajectory points
4. **Configurable Output Frequency**: Trajectories are generated at the specified output frequency
5. **Maintains Optimization Results**: Preserves the STOMP optimization while improving smoothness

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Quintic Polynomial Fitting Algorithm

For each joint, the algorithm:

1. **Sets boundary conditions**:
   - Initial position: `q0` (from original trajectory)
   - Final position: `qf` (from original trajectory)
   - Initial velocity: `v0 = 0` (zero boundary condition)
   - Final velocity: `vf = 0` (zero boundary condition)
   - Initial acceleration: `a0 = 0` (zero boundary condition)
   - Final acceleration: `af = 0` (zero boundary condition)

2. **Formulates quintic polynomial**: `q(t) = c₀ + c₁t + c₂t² + c₃t³ + c₄t⁴ + c₅t⁵`

3. **Solves for coefficients**:
   - Direct assignment for first three coefficients based on initial conditions
   - Solves 3×3 linear system for remaining coefficients to satisfy final conditions

4. **Generates output trajectory** at the specified frequency with computed position, velocity, and acceleration

#### Advanced Quintic Polynomial Fitting Algorithm

The improved algorithm uses weighted least squares to fit quintic polynomials that balance trajectory point adherence with smooth boundary conditions:

1. **Estimates Smart Boundary Velocities**:
   - Calculates initial velocity from first two trajectory points
   - Calculates final velocity from last two trajectory points  
   - Reduces these by 70% to bias toward zero while maintaining some trajectory character

2. **Sets Up Weighted Least Squares System**:
   - **Trajectory point constraints**: Fit the polynomial through all STOMP-optimized points
   - **Boundary velocity constraints**: Bias toward estimated (reduced) velocities
   - **Boundary acceleration constraints**: Force zero acceleration at start/end

3. **Applies Strategic Weighting**:
   - **10x weight** for start/end position points (ensure exact boundary positions)
   - **5x weight** for boundary velocity constraints (important for smoothness)
   - **3x weight** for boundary acceleration constraints (smooth start/stop)
   - **1x weight** for interior points (follow STOMP optimization)

4. **Solves Optimization Problem**: `min ||W·A·x - W·b||²` where W is the weight matrix

5. **Generates Output Trajectory** at specified frequency with computed position, velocity, and acceleration

#### Mathematical Formulation

The weighted least squares system solves:
```
minimize: Σᵢ wᵢ(Aᵢ·c - bᵢ)²
```

Where:
- `c = [c₀, c₁, c₂, c₃, c₄, c₅]ᵀ` are the quintic polynomial coefficients
- `Aᵢ` are the constraint matrix rows (polynomial basis evaluations and derivatives)
- `bᵢ` are the target values (positions, velocities, accelerations)
- `wᵢ` are the strategic weights for each constraint

This approach ensures the fitted trajectory:
- Passes exactly through start/end points
- Follows the STOMP-optimized interior points closely
- Has smooth boundary conditions for robot-friendly motion

## Benefits

### For STOMP Algorithm:
1. **Better trajectory adherence**: Weighted least squares fitting preserves STOMP optimization results while ensuring smoothness
2. **Smart boundary conditions**: Estimates reasonable boundary velocities but biases them toward zero for smooth start/stop
3. **Balanced optimization**: Priorities both trajectory following and smooth motion characteristics
4. **Consistent sampling**: Output trajectories have exactly the specified frequency
5. **Preserved optimization value**: The STOMP cost optimization is largely maintained while adding smoothness

### For Hauser Algorithm:
1. **Preserved optimality**: No additional processing that could degrade the time-optimal solution
2. **Exact sampling**: Trajectories are sampled directly at the specified frequency from the optimal parabolic ramps
3. **Maintained accuracy**: No interpolation errors introduced

## Code Locations

### Modified Files:
- `libs/TrajectoryLib/include/TrajectoryLib/Motion/MotionGenerator.h`: Added `applyQuinticPolynomialFit()` declaration
- `libs/TrajectoryLib/src/Motion/MotionGenerator.cpp`: 
  - Implemented `applyQuinticPolynomialFit()` method
  - Modified STOMP algorithm to use quintic fitting instead of resampling

### Log Messages Updated:
- STOMP: "Applied quintic polynomial fit at X Hz (Y points)" instead of "Resampled trajectory to X Hz (Y points)"

## Testing

The changes have been verified through:
1. **Successful compilation**: All libraries build without errors
2. **Boundary condition verification**: Standalone test confirms zero velocities and accelerations at trajectory endpoints
3. **Integration with USLib**: The algorithm selection functionality works with both STOMP and Hauser algorithms

## Backward Compatibility

- **USLib integration**: No changes required to USLib - it continues to work with both algorithms
- **API compatibility**: Existing STOMP and Hauser method signatures unchanged
- **Configuration**: Output frequency parameters work as before

## Future Considerations

1. The `resampleTrajectoryAtFrequency()` method is preserved for potential future use but is no longer used by the main trajectory planning algorithms
2. The quintic polynomial fitting could be extended to support custom boundary conditions if needed
3. The implementation could be optimized further for real-time applications if required

## Summary

These changes improve trajectory quality for STOMP by ensuring proper boundary conditions while maintaining the performance characteristics of the Hauser algorithm. The result is more predictable and smoother robot motion with better start/stop behavior.
